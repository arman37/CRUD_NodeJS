A Simple CRUD app with nodeJS
==================================
Build a Complete NodeJS MVC Framework With powerful ExpressJS.
====================================================================

The idea is to demonstrate a custom MVC architecture in the context of Express & build a simple CRUD application with a RESTful web API.

HOW TO RUN
========
1. Create a mysql database named 'node_crud' with username = 'root' & password = ''
2. Clone the project from git.
3. Go to 'CRUD_NodeJS' directory.
4. Run "npm install".
5. Run "npm start".

Application will start at 'http://localhost:3000' but you will have to configure the frontend app at 'https://github.com/arman37/CRUD_ReactJS' to see how the API works.
